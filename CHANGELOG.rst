Changelog
---------

**Versions 9.1 to 11.1** where NeoVim exclusive versions. Before that there are Vim exclusive versions, 
and from **12.1** onwards, this config works both with Vim and NeoVim :)

* 12.3.0

  * Lots of improvements on config and data dirs handling by Baco, simplified hackish bits on the config dealing with paths.

* 12.2.1

  * Fix transparent background for some modern terminal apps like Alacritty

* 12.2.0

  * Lots of performance gains by replacing the colorizer plugin (the one that paints CSS colors with their actual color)

* 12.1.0

  * Fix: use the correct python interpreter when in NeoVim
  * Ability to set a transparent background (to use the terminal app background color), by setting transparent_background = 1

* 12.0.1

  * Fix for change in deoplete config format.

* 12.0.0  THE BIG UNIFICATION

  * Many of the changes are from the merge of the NeoVim config into the Vim config, so not new if you were using the NeoVim config. 
    If you were using the Vim version, I recommend you look down until version 9.1 to see more details. 
    But here are the main changes.
  * Replaced CtrlP with Fzf.vim for all the fuzzy finding features.
  * Replaced Vim-git with Fugitive for the git integration.
  * Deoplete is the new aotucompletion engine. Faster, because it's async.
  * Replaced Syntastic with NeoMake, also faster because of asynciness.
  * Removed some plugins and configs that had very little use (you can add them if you use them!):
      * Tabman (vertical tab manager).
      * SnipMate (code snippets).
      * Dragvisuals (visually move blocks of code).
      * YAPF (Python code formatter).
      * Tab length exceptions on some file types.
  * Changed tab movement shortcuts: now just use Alt+horizontal arrows to move between tabs.
  * Removed window movement mappings, which had a lot of conflicts with different terminals and environments.
  * Use NerdFonts for the fancy symbols, no more need for manual font patching.
  * Added vim-polyglot plugin (better language packs).
  * The emmet-vim plugin is back (fancy html generation).
  * Code checks assume python3 by default (you can comment the settings after "Check code as python3 by default").
  * Added optional nice file icons using Devicons.
  * Load custom configs at the end of the file, if present.
  * Mapping to add python breakpoints with ipdb (but easily configurable to something else).
  * Fancy symbols control with a setting!

* 11.1

  * Disable annoying inline error messages from neomake (the ones appearing next to the code lines)

* 11.0

  * Mapping to add python breakpoints with ipdb (but easily configurable to something else).
  * Added optional nice file icons.
