fisa-vim-config
===============

my vim configuration (lot of python, autocompletion, fuzzy finder, debugger, ...)

What is this?
-------------

**(IMPORTANT! updating from a previous version? check the install section for new dependencies, and read the updating instructions. It can also be useful to look at the CHANGELOG)**

My personal `Vim <http://www.vim.org/>`_ configuration, built according to my personal preferences, without any justification to think it's the best possible vim configuration. If you like it, great! :)
It's mainly oriented to python software development, but many of its features are useful for other languages and editing tasks.

Feel free to distribute it (it's GPL licensed), and I'm not responsible for any good or bad consecuences of using it (I don't know how a vim configuration can harm you, but you should never underestimate the power of vim :p).

You can report any issue on the `Issues <https://github.com/fisadev/fisa-vim-config/issues>`_ section. And if you need/want to contact me, my gmail account is "fisadev".

(the font I'm using is CPMono regular, you can find it `here <http://cooltext.com/Download-Font-CPMono>`_)

Most important features include:

* **Plugins managed using Vundle**! You can easily install or remove plugins, and they are installed into ``.vim/bundle/``. More info `here <https://github.com/gmarik/vundle>`_

* **Smart autocompletion as you type**, sometimes using python instrospection (completion of module names, instance methods and attributes) and sometimes text-based (used words) (from version 4.0, it's even more intelligent!). Most of the time is automatically displayed, but you can force it to appear using ``Ctrl-space``.

* **Fuzzy file, code and command finder** (like Textmante or Sublime Text 2):

  * ``,e`` = open file (like the original :e) but with recursive and fuzzy file name matching. Example: if you type "mopy" it will find a file named "models.py" placed on a subdirectory. And allows you to open the selected file on a new tab with ``Ctrl-t``!
  * ``,g`` = fuzzy symbol finder (classes, methods, variables, functions, ...) on the current file. Example: if you type "usr" it will find the User class definition on the current file. ``,G`` does the same but on all opened files.
  * ``,c`` = fuzzy command finder (internal vim commands, or custom commands). Example: if you type "diff" it will find ``:GitDiff``, ``:diffthis``, and many other similar commands.
  * ``,f`` = fuzzy text finder on all the opened files. Example: if you type "ctm=6" it will find the line containing "current_time = 16".
  * ``,m`` = fuzzy finder of most recently used files.
  * ``,we``, ``,wg``, ``,wc``, ``,wf`` and ``,wm`` = same as ``,e``, ``,g``, ``,c``, ``,f`` and ``,wm`` but initiate the search with the word under the cursor (also the upper case version of ``,G``, ``,wG``). Is useful to think about the ``,wg`` as a "fuzzy go to definition" (if the definition is in the same file, or ``,wG`` if the definition is on any of the opened files).
  * ``,pe`` = same as ``,e`` but initiates the search with the path under the cursor.


* **Jedi-vim for really neat python goodies!**:

  * **Go to definition** with ``,d``, or open the definition on a new tab with ``,D``.
  * **Go to assignment** with ``,a``.
  * **Find occurrences** with ``,o``.
  * And it is the power behind the magic python autocompletion.

* **Classes/module browser** that lists classes, functions, methods, and such of the current file, and navigates to them when ENTER is pressed. Toggle it with ``F4``.

* **Pending tasks browser** pressing ``F2``. This reads the current file searching for comments that start with "TODO", "FIXME", and such, and shows them on a list that allows navigation similar to the class browser.

* **Error checking of python code** using Pyflakes (it will detect unused variables or imports, syntax errors, and such).

* Run **PEP8 validator** on the current python file with ``\8``, which also displays python errors found with Pyflakes.

* A really nice **python and php debugger**. `Here <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kairdgZCD1U&feature=player_embedded>`_ is a small tutorial about it, and I added some keyboard shortcuts to easy its usage (they should be used only once the debugger started!):

  * ``F5`` = step over
  * ``F6`` = step into
  * ``F7`` = step out
  * ``F8`` = execute until cursor position is reached
  * ``F9`` = toggle breakpoint
  * ``F10`` = evaluate expressions on the expressions window (watch)
  * ``F11`` = go down on the stack
  * ``F12`` = go up on the stack

  You should watch the `video tutorial <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kairdgZCD1U&feature=player_embedded>`_, I can't explain all its usage here.

  FAQ: Why there isn't a keyboard shortcut to start the debugger?

  Because there where no more "Fx" keys free, and starting the debugger is something you do only once on every debugging session, compared to the multiple times you will use the other functions on that session. Disagree? Change it! Edit the ``.vimrc`` file, is really simple and well documented :).  (The command **to start the debugger on the current file** is ``:Dbg .``)

* **Grep text recursively** and navigate the results:

  * ``,r`` uses the system grep (faster).
  * ``,R`` uses vimgrep (slower).
  * ``,wr`` and ``,wR`` do the same, but searching the word under the cursor.

* Some settings for better **tabs and spaces handling**.

* **Better file browser**, toggle it with ``F3``.

* **Results count** while searching text.

* **Search and read python documentation** with the ``:Pydoc`` command. Example: ``:Pydoc collections`` (also works over the current word with vim's default help keybinding: ``Shift-K``).

* **Comment and uncomment code** with ``\ci``.

* **Easy tab navigation**:

  * ``tt`` = new tab and leaves the cursor waiting to specify the file path to open (leave blank to open an empty tab).
  * ``tn`` or ``Ctrl-Shift-Right`` = next tab.
  * ``tp`` or ``Ctrl-Shift-Left`` = previous tab.
  * ``tm`` = move current tab to a specific position (or to the end if no position number is specified).
  * ``tl`` = show a list of current tabs with their inner windows on a side pane. You can navigate them!
  * ``ts`` = duplicate current tab.

  The mappings starting with the ``t`` letter work only on command mode, but the mappings with ``Ctrl-Shift`` work on both, command and insert mode.

* **Easy window navigation** using ``Alt-arrows`` keys.

* Some vim goodies enabled by default:

  * **incremental search** (moves to the first result while you are typing).
  * **highlighted search results**.
  * **line numbers**.
  * keep **cursor 3 lines away from screen border while scrolling**.
  * **shell-like autocompletion of commands and paths** (autocomplete the common part and show matching options).
  * **syntax highlighting on** by default.

* **Python interpreter inside vim**, or any other console. They are opened as a buffer using the command ``:ConqueTerm``. Examples: ``:ConqueTerm python``, ``:ConqueTerm bash``.

* **Save current file as sudo** using ``:w!!``.

* **Navigate html/xml tags** the same way that you navigate (), {} and []: using ``%``.

* **Beautiful status line allways visible**, with colors, breadcrumbs and useful information about file type, encoding and position. When working with python files, it also displays the current python function or class where the cursor is.

* **Automatically removes trailing spaces** when saving python files.

* **Smart autoclosing of (, [, and {**

* **Beautiful color schemes for on vim with 256 colors (fisa colorscheme) and gvim (wombat colorscheme)**.

* **Use of 256 colors** when possible.

* **2 spaces indentation for html and javascript** (can disable it removing two lines from the ``.vimrc``).

* **Thousands of code snippets for many languages** with SnipMate. Example, in python you can write ``cl`` and press ``Ctrl-k``, and it will insert the boilerplate code of a common python class (then use ``Ctrl-k`` to navigate the snippet fields).

* **Zen coding** for html: generate lots of html code writing simple and short expressions.
  Example:

  1. write ``#books>ul>li.book*5>a``
  2. press ``Ctrl-y ,``
  3. it will generate:

     ::

      <div id="books">
          <ul>
              <li class="book">
                  <a href=""></a>
              </li>
              <li class="book">
                  <a href=""></a>
              </li>
              <li class="book">
                  <a href=""></a>
              </li>
              <li class="book">
                  <a href=""></a>
              </li>
              <li class="book">
                  <a href=""></a>
              </li>
          </ul>
      </div>

* **Git integration**, with commands such as: ``:GitStatus``, ``:GitDiff``, ``:GitBlame``, ``:GitLog``, ``:GitCommit``, or simply ``:Git`` with your own command. Also includes key mappings and syntax highlighting for git displays. And displays icons on the side of each line based on the result of a git diff of the current file (example: if you added a line and still didn't commit the file, that line will have a green ``+`` on its side).

* **Better python indentation**.

* Really neat **surround actions** using the surround.vim plugin. Learn how to use it `here <https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround>`_.

* **Indentation defined text objects** for the editing language, named ``i``. For example, you can change an entire indented code block with ``cii``, or the indented block and its header line with ``cai`` (also yank, delete, ...).

* **Copy history navigation** using the YankRing plugin, which allows you to cicle the vim clipboard with ``Ctrl-p`` and ``Ctrl-n``, and many other features (described `here <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1234>`_).

* **Insert ipdb breakpoints** with ``\b``.

Super easy installation
-----------------------

(you will need a vim compiled with python support. Check it with ``vim --version | grep +python``)

(**if you have your own .vim folder or have a version of fisa-vim-config older than 3.0, you should move it to a backup location and start with no .vim folder!**)

* **Dependencies**

  ::

    sudo apt-get install vim exuberant-ctags git
    sudo pip install dbgp vim-debug pep8 flake8 pyflakes

  (if you don't have Pip, find it here: `pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_)

* **Put the configuration files where they belong**

  Place the file ``.vimrc`` on your linux home folder.

  Example: my linux user is "fisa", so now I have: ``/home/fisa/.vimrc``.

* **Open vim**

  Simply run ``vim`` on your terminal, and it will try to install the plugins. They will be installed into the ``.vim/bundle`` folder.

  Wait for the installation to finish...

  Done! You have your new shiny powerful vim :)

* **Optional: fancy symbols and breadcrumbs**

  If you want fancy symbols and breadcrumbs on your status line, there is a small tutorial for that at the end of this README.

Keeping your vim up-to-date
---------------------------

After downloading the new version of the ``.vimrc`` file, you should close vim, and run (on the terminal):

  ::

    vim +BundleClean +BundleInstall! +qa 

(this will remove plugins no longer used, install any new plugins, and update the existing ones to the last versions). 

You can also run ``:BundleInstall!`` from inside vim at any time to update the installed plugins (and restart vim after it finishes).

Optional: fancy symbols and breadcrumbs in the status line
----------------------------------------------------------

Airline allows you to use fancy symbols on the status line for breadcrumbs and indicators (example: a padlock when editing read-only files). Using them requires to have a patched font in your terminal. It may sound black magic, but in fact is quite easy.

Airline doesn't come with the font patcher than Powerline came with but you
can grab the fonts from [this repository](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts). If you want to patch instead, you will need to grab the font patcher and proceed as said below:

**Patch**

First we will need to patch a font. Pick the font you want to patch (it should be a monospace font). Copy its .ttf file (on Ubuntu you can find them under ``/usr/share/fonts/truetype/``) to the ``.vim/bundle/vim-Powerline/fontpatcher`` folder. Cd into that folder and run ``./fontpatcher YOURFONTFILE.ttf``. Now you will have a file named ``YOURFONTFILE-Powerline.ttf``, that's your patched font.

**Install**

Now we need to install the patched font to our system. On Ubuntu, double click on the font file and choose "install". On other systems copy the font file to the ``YOURHOMEFOLDER/.fonts/`` folder and then run ``sudo fc-cache -vf``.

**Configure**

After installing the font, go to the settings of your terminal app and select the patched font. Finally, open your ``.vimrc`` and uncomment the line ``let g:Powerline_symbols = 'fancy'``.

That's it! Restart your vim and enjoy the beauty of Airline.
